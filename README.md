# TrainingApp

A cross-platorm mobile application that allows humans to train robots that use the [Fido library](https://github.com/FidoProject/Fido). Robots that use this application are included in the [Hardware repo](https://github.com/FidoProject/Hardware). The app is written in Ionic using AngularJS and HTML/CSS. 

For the time being, this app is not available on the app store.

## Installation

First install node.js 4 (very important it is not node.js 5).
Then, install ionic and cordova using `sudo npm install --global ionic cordova`.
Next, navigate to the `/app` directory, and run `npm install`, `bower install`, and `ionic state reset`. This will install all the dependencies.

## Development

See the [ionic framework's instructions](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/testing.html) on running an application.
